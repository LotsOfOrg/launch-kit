## How to use

Launch Kit provides simple, transparent utilities for building
production-ready FastHTML applications. Here’s a quick example of using
the authentication utilities:

``` python
from launch_kit.auth import hash_password, verify_password

# Hash a password when user signs up
password = "secure_password123"
hashed = hash_password(password)
print(f"Hashed: {hashed[:20]}...")

# Verify password when user logs in
is_valid = verify_password(password, hashed)
print(f"Valid: {is_valid}")
```
